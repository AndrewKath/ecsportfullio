	  <h3>SKIING</h3>
	  <p>One of my first acomplishments i did on skis was doing my first 360. This took lots of time and effort I remember the day i did it I must have tried 20 times before I got it. The reason I tried so hard to do it was beacause of my brother he inspired me and tought me how to do lots of things on skis </p>

	  <p> Ove the years that I ave been skiing I have learned lots of new tricks and ways to ski. after training for it I decided to jump off of a 20 Foot cliff. when i did this I landed in a way that would keep me from hurting myselfl. that was the biggest cliff that I have ever jumped off of to this day.</p>
